            Since childhood, I{"'"}ve been obsessed with technology, a gamer
            at heart who always had a PC nearby. My interest in computers led me
            to pursue a Bifocal Computer Science degree in junior college, which is
            when I really fell in love with coding. A recent Bacholer{"'"} in Computer Science graduate in
            2024, I sought practical experience early, interning at Neki Infosys
            in my second year. I gained the confidence to launch my own startup,
            leading a team of five to create diverse web solutions, from websites
            to blogs and portfolios, while still doing my degree. Now, Iâ€™m
            immersed in web and mobile development, fascinated by the potential
            of bringing practical experiences to life, and yes, AI. What started
            as a gamer dreaming of building playable {'"AI agents,"'} has turned
            into a deep fascination with generative AI and its exploration.
